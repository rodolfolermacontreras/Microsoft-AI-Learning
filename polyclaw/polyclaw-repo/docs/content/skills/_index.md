Skills are instructions that teach Polyclaw how to perform specific tasks. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown instructions.

## How Skills Work

When a user invokes a skill (by verb or topic match), the skill's instructions are loaded into the agent's context. The LLM uses these instructions to guide its behavior for that interaction.

Skills are not code -- they are natural language instructions that leverage the agent's existing tool capabilities (MCP servers, built-in tools, etc.).

## Skill Format

```
my-skill/
  SKILL.md           # Required
  (supporting files)  # Optional
```

### SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: My Skill
description: A brief description of what this skill does
metadata:
  verb: myverb
---

## Skill Sources

Skills come from four sources, tracked via a `.origin` file in each skill directory:

| Source | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Built-in** | `skills/` (project root) | Shipped with Polyclaw |
| **Agent-created** | `~/.polyclaw/skills/` | Created by the agent during conversations |
| **Plugin-provided** | `~/.polyclaw/skills/` | Installed when a plugin is enabled |
| **Marketplace** | `~/.polyclaw/skills/` | Downloaded from remote catalogs |
